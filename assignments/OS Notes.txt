Testing harness - load a bunch of programs and 
	Try and create fragmentation test program and measure disk performance. (with big and small )
	Must exercise io delay
	
	

loader - create pid entry
scheduler - ready/ suspended/ running processes  (randomly pick process to run, 1 instruction)
process table -
	pid - get pid number
	context switch ()
	filename
	registers - for register (nice to have) 
	
	program counter - virtual address (0 is top of process) pass in the virtual page number
		offset is the instruction in the page
		virtual page number is the address shifted by the 
		physical page is returned by lookup() and in the offset
	state - running, ready, waiting, suspended
	
	look up register r0 then read and write the memory.
